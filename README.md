FileHelper
==========

I was unimpressed by C#'s native File and Path classes, so I made my own, mainly using the classes but allowing for more methods to get more data easier.


This is a library programmed in C#.  It is used, as noted above, to make getting pathes and utilizing text files easier.  It isn't overly hard at the moment, but I'm looking for it to be so simple a caveman could do it.  I will likely use this library in any future C# projects I do.
